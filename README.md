# IndividualProject

This project will be a calculator that can solve 3x3 matricies by inputting numbers into each text box to represent the numbers in the matrix, and clicking a text box that corresponds to the function that they would like to perform. The results will be displayed in either a single text box for integer results or if the answer is a matrix, an array of 9 text boxes.

Some of the functions only use one matrix, while others use two. I will attempt to include functions for diagonalization, determinants, and inverses (all single matrix functions) as well as adding and multiplying of two matrices that would be inputted by the user.

early version of UI is included in documentation
